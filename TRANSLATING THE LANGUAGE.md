# First To Translate It You Need To Use This Table 
### Table : a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4, e = 5, h = 6, i = 7, j = 8, k = 9, l = 10, m = 11, n = 12, 0 = 13, p = 14, q = 15, r = 16, s = 17, t = 18, u = 19, v = 20, w = 21, x = 22, y = 23, z = 24
# I Know It Sounds Hard (And I Haven't Completed the table yet) But With My Instruction From The Creator Itself You Will Be FINE.
## First you have to add up the sum of the alphabetical number example : c means 2+1 because the alphabetical number is 3 you have to make a sum of c like 2+1 = 3 which is the alphabetical number of c
