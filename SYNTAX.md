# The Syntax For AltSum Encoded Binary Language Or AltSum, Some Syntax Is Same As Java So, If A Java Programmer Wants To Learn The Syntax It's Easy For Them.
## 1. Use | when writing different sums for different letter/glyphs
## 2. don't write a sum which is like this 3+2 which the alphabetical number is this : 5 this is wrong if you want to get the result of the alphabetical number 5 do 4+1 with +1 in the end of the sum.
## 3. when a line of code (not function or classes) is complete, end it with ; not a blank. 
## 4. when writing functions inside the functions put { just after the functions sums and } when the function is complete.
## 5. Write one line comment like this : // and end the comment like this // for multi line comment do this /* and end with */
## 6. This set of sum's syntax declares a Class OR a function to be public
      15+1|20+1|1+1|11+1|8+1|4+1
## 7. you cannot randomly put this set of sum ANYWHERE so you have to put them on top of the code, and this set of sums mean that you declare a class but you have to type the name of your file (without file extension) (encoded) for it to work
      2+1|11+1|0.5+0.5|18+1|18+1
## 8. this set of sums mean that it WILL NOT return a value in the function otherwise remove this set of code from a function : "18+1|19+1|0.5+0.5|19+1|8+1|2+1" for this set of sums to work.
      21+1|14+1|8+1|3+1
