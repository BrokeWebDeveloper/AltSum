# The Syntax For AltSum Encoded Binary Language Or AltSum, Some Syntax Is Same As Java So, If A Java Programmer Wants To Learn The Syntax It's Easy For Them.
## 1. Use | when writing different sums for different letter/glyphs
## 2. don't write a sum which is like this 3+2 which the alphabetical number is this : 5 this is wrong if you want to get the result of the alphabetical number 5 do 4+1 with +1 in the end of the sum.
## 3. when a line of code is complete, end it with ; not a blank. 
## 4. when writing functions inside the functions put { just after the functions sums and } when the function is complete.
## 5. To be continued.. (Syntax Still In Development)
